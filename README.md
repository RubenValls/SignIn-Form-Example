<h1>Sign In Formulary with White and Dark mode</h1>
<hr>

<p>Firstly, the main aim of this repository is to show my work adapting the actual (19/09/2022) sign in page at Dribble and try to include some changes. Also, a dark and white button. So, let's see both formularies:</p>

<p>As you can see, both pages are pretty familiar. Just some changes like Twitter button and the use of different kind of text fonts. The "hover" functions are the same. But the most important change is the implementation of dark and white button. Let's compare my implementation with white and black background:</p>

<p>Hope it could be helpful to someone. For me, it was a great experience to grow my knowledge and try to improve in development world.</p>
